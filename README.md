## Notes

- I'd highly recommend to watch Savjee's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124&list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4) series. It's a great introduction to blockchain's implementation.
- The University of Edinburgh also has a course _[Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers](https://github.com/dimkarakostas/blockchaincourse)_ talking more topics in technical details.
- If you are interested in one of blockchain's applications "Web3", you can check out the book _[How the Web3 reinvents the Internet](https://github.com/sherminvo/TokenEconomyBook)_. It talks about how the future of the Web works with blockchain.
